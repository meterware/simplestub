<h2>Simulating file I/O</h2>

<p>File I/O in a unit test has a number of issues, including performance and platform-specific
    behavior. One common approach when there are a small number of predefined files to read is to
    store them as a resources in a project and then use relative paths to locate them, but that can
    tricky in multi-module projects, which might be run either from the top-level directory or the
    module-directory. It's also possible to create temporary files for the code to read, but that
    doesn't help when there is some reason that a program must read from a particular path.
    The <a href="/apidocs/com/meterware/simplestub/stubs/InMemoryFileSystem.html">InMemoryFileSystem</a>
    class provides an alternate approach.
